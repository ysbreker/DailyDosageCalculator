Daily dosage calculator
=======================

A simple tool to calculate the correct daily dosage of medication to use when you are measuring your INR yourself. 

This tool is nothing more than a digital version of the flowchart and two tables I got at the self measurement course I followed at the local Thrombosis measurement lab.

__Use this thing at your own peril!__ 

This tool is useless for anyone who doesn't take Acenocoumarol on a daily basis and measures his or her INR value themselves using a CoaguChek XS.
